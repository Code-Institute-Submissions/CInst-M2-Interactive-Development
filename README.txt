As a conformation of my abilities to integrate websites with existing APIs, MidiMAPS was transformed via GoolgeMaps and GooglePlaces API's into a fully interactive virtualization of the world we live in. Search citys in select countrys to explore hotels around the world. MidiMaps responds to users interactions allowing them to actively engage with data set served through the API. When ever a  user clicks on the map  MidiMaps will display that location in a street view allowing virtual explorations.

## UX

### User stories

As an hotel seeker I expect midimaps to showcase hotels around the world.

As a virtual explorer I expect to be able to explore that enviorment without being present.

### Strategy
My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access all information on the site while striving to keep all map views as big as possible.

### Scope
With COVID-19 we have to find use of all this new time MidiMaps is a great way to travel this world when you cannot be physically present

### Structure
The search section allows users to select a country, that will bound user input to that country, auto complete provides the correct city in selected country.

### Surface
Deafualt color schemes utilized to ensue user familiarity.


## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Bootstrap 


## Features
This site utilizes Bootstrap to create a 4 quadrant grid layout. Google maps API was utilized to remove default map functionality, in order to expand user map space and remove the option for eternal link use, to ensure user stays within this application. 

### Features Left to Implement
In the future, I would like to implement Virtual Reality API, allowing the site to display in VR.


## Testing
The hotel seeker and virtual explore user stories Achieve the intended goals by providing hotel search functionality within the site. If you’re using mini maps as a virtual explorer your all set to click away.

To minimize the chance of users inputting the wrong data the country select button is bound to the input search only propergating city’s in selected country.


This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone 4, 5, 7: Chrome and Safari, iPad, Samsung Galaxy) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness via [responsinator](https://www.responsinator.com/)
